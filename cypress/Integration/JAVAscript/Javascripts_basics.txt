1.  // comment line
    /* multi line comment */

2.  var --- global/function level (only function not block level)
    so to avoid confusion

    let is using everywhere ----global/ block level
    const is similar to let except re assign

    let redeclare is not possible but var can

3.  if, if else, while, for loop almost same

4. In JavaScript, objects can be created using object literals, constructor functions, or classes. 
    let person={
    name1: "chaip",
    name2:"prachai"
    }
    console.log("javascript of objects  "+person.name1)

5. Variables declared with let or const should be within a block scope, and 
   class body itself does not qualify as a block scope.
